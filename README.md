## Topics to cover
First of all, sorry for my English. 

### Why typescript?
I never used ts in my projects(at work) and I thought that this could be a good moment, to know more.

#### Why Formik?
I used in all my projects redux-form. I was searching for another complex library who has no interaction with redux. Just to loose coupling.  

#### why not [Structure your application in a standard way](https://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/)?
With React 16.8 we can use Hooks to use Redux. We don't have to use library redux. My point is that Redux is a concept, not just a library. To lose coupling, could be a good idea to generate a little more abstraction in what would be redux.
So I create my folder store and put all files(actions, reducers, types) there.

#### Jest & Enzyme
I consider myself new in these practices and try to follow TDD methodologies.
